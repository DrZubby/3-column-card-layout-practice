**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

There is an urgent need for me to learn how to implement external font styles in a webpage.

I also need to improve my layout skills such that There will hardly be a need to use media queries for building responsive designs.

I also have to improve on my proficiency with styling buttons.
Finally, it would be grat if I am able to improve on the area of orginising my code and making it slightly more readable.
